                <p>The SkinCeuticals story began with Dr. Sheldon Pinnellâ€™s groundbreaking research on vitamin C in 1992, long before the
                company was established in 1997. In the years since, SkinCeuticals has remained committed to using evidence-based
                research to develop new antioxidant and cosmeceutical formulations, and has grown to become the #1 Medical Skincare
                Brand in the U.S."[1]</p>
                <p>At SkinCeuticals, the formulation philosophy is driven by the physician-based skincare prescription for optimal skin
                health: prevent future signs of aging with antioxidants, correct visible concerns advanced corrective products and
                protect healthy skin with sunscreen. An effective skincare regimen must contain these three fundamental elements before
                being further customized and tailored for every unique skin need.</p>
